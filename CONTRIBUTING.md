## Things to do

### Unit tests

It's also good to add additional unit-tests or improve existing ones.

We use `RSpec` as unit-testing framework.
You need to follow [BetterSpec](http://betterspecs.org).

### Fix issues

You can start picking one [here](https://github.com/alem0lars/basel/issues).

### Improve existing documentation

Both developer and user documentation need a lot of work and making it better
means the project can get more contributions / donations which is what can keep
this project alive. They are stored inside the
[`docs`](https://github.com/alem0lars/basel/blob/master/docs) directory.

Also, you can contribute adding more API documentation, i.e. doc-strings in
the [source code](https://github.com/alem0lars/basel/blob/master/lib).

Consider this kind of contribution possibly the best you can do.

To start, just write some documentation you think it's missing and/or important
for other users / developers. When you finished writing it, create a
pull-request and it will be reviewed.

### System integration

You can provide integration with an existing operating system.

This means:

- Adding a basel package for its package manager.
- Adding a special / specific integration for the system itself.
  *Always keep in mind the cross-platform design of basel.*

### Spread the word

More people involved with basel means more more people helping it's
development.

Just spread the word where you want: twitter, irc, facebook, google+, your
neighbour, etc..
